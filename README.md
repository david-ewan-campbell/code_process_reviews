I'm working through the Makers Process Reviews to help in my consolidation process. This is a series of code challenges not unlike the Katas in Code Wars and are a very useful point to get 'back-to-basics' and just practice some essential root skills in making simple coding solutions using TDD.

This has also been a chance to revisit Ruby as the language that first introduced me to the joys of trying to write coding solutions.

I'm aiming to work incrementally with thorough TDD principles and work from error messages, turning red 'failures' into green passing tests as a means to keep testing and practicing and building on the ongoing consolidation process.
